# mafia-app

You need to install the package shiny.
I have also called ggplot2 and grid as I plan to use it in the future. So you could either install these or comment out the 2 lines in the server code. 
All the .wav files need to be saved in a subfolder named www within the folder that contains the ui and server apps. 
This is the base version and hence only includes mafia, cop, doctor and villagers. It can easily be updated to include other special characters
